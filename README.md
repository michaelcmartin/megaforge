MegaForge
=========

A savegame editor for Capcom's "Mega Man" series of classic platformers. The games covered here actually used a password system, but those passwords encoded the game state and can thus be generated.

The algorithms.txt file documents the various password schemes. The remaining files implement an interactive web encoder for them.
